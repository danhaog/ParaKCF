# Summary
We are going to extend the the Kernalized Correlation Filter (KCF) [1, 2], a fast oject tracker, to a multicore platform and even GPU.

# Background
Visual oject tracking is one of the popular tasks in the computer vision area. There are a lot of different implementations focusing on how to improve the accuracy of the tracking algorithm. These implementations mostly target at the "real time" systems, these algorithms have been aimed at approximate frame rate of 30 Frames Per Second(FPS), which is enough for previous devices and workloads. However, for higher frame rate cameras (240 FPS) or an offline video processing pipeline, 30 FPS still seems to be slow. We look through some of the benchmark results [3, 4] and find this Kernalized Correlation Filter which provide top speed on CPU and pretty good accuracy. We decide to further extend this algorithm to be able to benefit from multicore systems and be fast enough to be used offline.

By creating the circulant training data matrix, KCF uses Discrete Fourier Transform (dft) to compute the close form solution of Ridge Regression and reduce both the storage and computation. It further uses HOG feature instead of raw pixels to gain better mean precision on the testing dataset. The main computation lies in the dft and HOG feature extraction. There are plenty of fast parallel algorithms for dft and HOG feature extraction should also be able to be parallelized so we decide to build the parallel oject tracker based on the KCF implementation. 

# Challenge

# Resources
The Author of KCF open source their [code](https://github.com/joaofaro/KCFcpp) on the github so we are able to build our parallel version based on their implementation. We would develop and test our software on the GHC machines which have 8 cores and we may further test the performance on Xepm Phi machines or develop the GPU version to see how our implementation scales if everything goes smoothly.
